# The newspaper

That new intern quite messed up I must say! Instead of putting actual news to the page he was messing up
with styles the whole day and nobody asked him to do that. In addition to that he uploaded that file and something
glitched out, so we can neither delete the file nor edit `html` or `css`, the only thing we can do is upload `js` file
to fix it. So this is your time to shine! There is the broken mold file uploaded, please make a js file that fixes
everything according to the list attached below. I suggest you to first try it in the browser devtools console, once you
are sure it’s working you can put it inside your js file P.S. And don’t worry, he’s already fired :)

## Acceptance criteria:
- `#title`’s content is “Breaking News”
- `#description` has style “letter-spacing: 0.2em”
- `.news-container`’s background color is white
- `.news-container`’s last child “div” has a class “feed”
- Second `.news__title`'s content is wrapped with `h3` tag
- `#datetime` shows actual date (For ex: Sun, May 15 2022)
